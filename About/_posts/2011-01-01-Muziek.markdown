God bless us everyone<br>
We're a broken people living under loaded gun<br>
And it can't be outfought<br>
It can't be outdone<br>
It can't out matched<br>
It can't be outrun<br>
No<br>
<br>
God bless us everyone<br>
We're a broken people living under loaded gun<br>
And it can't be outfought<br>
It can't be outdone<br>
It can't out matched<br>
It can't be outrun<br>
No<br>
<br>
And when I close my eyes tonight<br>
To symphonies of blinding light<br>
God bless us everyone<br>
We're a broken people living under loaded gun<br>
Oh<br>
Like memories in cold decay<br>
Transmissions echoing away<br>
Far from the world of you and I<br>
Where oceans bleed into the sky<br>
<br>
God save us everyone,<br>
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?<br>
For the sins of our hand<br>
The sins of our tongue<br>
The sins of our father<br>
The sins of our young<br>
No<br>
<br>
God save us everyone,<br>
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?<br>
For the sins of our hand<br>
<br>
The sins of our tongue<br>
The sins of our father<br>
The sins of our young<br>
No<br>
<br>
And when I close my eyes tonight<br>
To symphonies of blinding light<br>
God save us everyone,<br>
Will we burn inside the fires of a thousand suns?<br>
Oh<br>
Like memories in cold decay<br>
Transmissions echoing away<br>
Far from the world of you and I<br>
Where oceans bleed into the sky<br>
<br>
Like memories in cold decay<br>
Transmissions echoing away<br>
Far from the world of you and I<br>
Where oceans bleed into the sky<br>
<br>
<br>
Lift me up<br>
Let me go ...<br>
<br>
God bless us everyone<br>
We're a broken people living under loaded gun<br>
And it can't be outfought<br>
Can't be outdone<br>
It can't out matched<br>
It can't be outrun<br>
No<br>
<br>
God bless us everyone<br>
We're a broken people living under loaded gun<br>
And it can't be outfought<br>
Can't be outdone<br>
It can't out matched<br>
It can't be outrun<br>
