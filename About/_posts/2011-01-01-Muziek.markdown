<br>
<br>

When you were standing in the wake of devastation<br>
when you were waiting on the edge of the unknown<br>
with the cataclysm raining down, insides crying save me now<br>
you were there and possibly alone.<br>
<br>
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation<br>
you build up all the failures all you've known<br>
remember all the sadness and frustration<br>
and let it go, let it go.<br>
<br>
And in the burst of light that blinded every angel<br>
as if the sky had blown the heavens into stars<br>
you felt the gravity of temper grace falling into empty space<br>
no one there to catch you in there arms<br>
<br>
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation<br>
you build up all the failures all you've known<br>
remember all the sadness and frustration<br>
and let it go, let it go.<br>
<br>
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation<br>
you build up all the failures all you've known<br>
remember all the sadness and frustration<br>
and let it go,<br>
<br>
let it go<br>
let it go<br>
let it go<br>
let it go<br>
<br>
Do you feel cold and lost in desperation<br>
you build up all the failures all you've known<br>
remember all the sadness and frustration<br>
and let it go, let it go.<br>
