title: Me, myself and I
---

"Passion makes the world go round." Well, in my world it does. Lack of passion
is not something you can accuse me of and I tend to incorporate it in
everything I do. On a professional level I'm passionate about software
architecture, about doing the right thing in the right way.

Professional might be an understatement, because in my not so copious spare
time I also tend to enjoy the company of my MacBooks to work on some fun
project. Most of these are open source, something I deeply believe in.

But, there is more than [computers](IT/) in my life. I'm happily married to
Kristien Tambuyzer and our little daughter [Eline](http://eline.vg) really
brightens up every day of our life. Soon though she will have to share our
attention with a little brother or sister.

[Cooking](Koken/), [digital photography](Fotografie/) and [catamaran
sailing](Zeilen/) complete the initial picture of my world. Below are a few more pages that add some more personal details.

And please remember: "If you think I'm arrogant, you're missing the point."
