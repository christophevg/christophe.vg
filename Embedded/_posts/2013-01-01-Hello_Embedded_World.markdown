title: Hello Embedded World
---

While doing research for possible master thesis topics, I'm looking into the
idea of wireless sensor network. At KULeuven the DISTRINET research group is
spending quiet some effort into this and I want to make sure that I fully
understand it before I decide to move in this direction or not.

This page is about bootstrapping my way into the embedded world. It follows my
[first steps in electronics](FirstSteps.html) and aims to get a Hello World
style implementation running on an ATMEGA168-20PU.

## Coming soon ;-)
