title: Embedded Systems According to Christophe VG
---

After more than 30 years doing (mostly administrative) software, I decided to
make a rather big switch and move into the hardware world, more specifically the
area of embedded systems.

Most of the code found in these pages is also available in my [Github embedded
repository](https://github.com/christophevg/embedded).
