If you live in Belgium and want to use your eID on Mac OS X, things aren't all
that nice. 

## Keychain/Safari Integration

As of Mac OS X 10.7 things got even worst due to the removal of the
previously included BELPIC Tokend. This now needs to be installed manually.

These three steps have recently been succesful at getting an ACR28 cardreader
(the one handed out by the Belgian government) to authenticate Safari.

### Step 1: install driver

Visit the manufacturer's website and download the latest driver. In case of the
ACR38 it is
[http://www.acs.com.hk/index.php?pid=drivers&id=ACR38](http://www.acs.com.hk/ind
ex.php?pid=drivers&id=ACR38).

Validate that it works by plugging in the reader and inserting your card. The
light on the reader should stop blinking an be on all the time - indicating
your card was read and accepted.


### Step 2: Install Tokend voor BELPIC

As of Mac OS X 10.7 the Tokend's for several cards are no longer shipped. They
are downloadable from MacOSForge. 
[http://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/installers](http://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/installers)
Download and install (at least) the BELPIC Tokend.

Validate that it works by opening your Keychain Access app and see that you
card is added to the list of keychains.

### Step 3:  Test it ...

Visit [https://test.eid.belgium.be](https://test.eid.belgium.be) and test your
setup.
