title: Dash7 First Steps
---

Dash7 is a specification for an ultra low power network stack, operating within
the sub-GHz spectrum. It's still young and sometimes rough around the edges, so
this page documents some first guide steps into leveraging what is already
available right now.

**DISCLAIMER**: I was part of the MOSAIC LoPoW research group for a year. So of
course I have a bias towards Dash7 ;-) Now, being more a user than a producer,
standing on the actual open source (user) end of the project, I feel like
advocating and supporting it from the ground up, making it more available to
everybody outside of the inner circle.
