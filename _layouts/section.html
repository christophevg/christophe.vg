      In this section of the site I collect recipes of dishes I've prepared in
      the past. Most of them are fine-tuned to the likings of my guests.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Language Disclaimer</b><br>
      All recipes are in Dutch, my mother tongue, since I'm from Belgium - 
      yeah I know, please don't hold it against me ;-)

      If you have sailed a cat you simply know that there is little more to
      look for in sports.

      All sailing stories are in Dutch, my mother tongue, since I'm from 
      Belgium - yeah I know, please don't hold it against me ;-)

  IT: 
    "<p>
      With over 30 years of hands-on experience with computers, I can hardly
      deny that I have strong feelings about IT.
     </p>
     <p>
       I'm a firm believer in Open Source, a happy Mac user and a strong
       advocate of 'doing to right thing' when it comes to software 
       architecture.

      <b>Language Disclaimer</b><br>
      Most of the posts in this section are in English, but since it's not my
      mother tongue, there will be mistakes ;-)

  Fotografie:
    "<p>
      I'm the proud owner of a Nikon D90. This beauty allows to me to capture
      the world the way I tend to see it.
     </p>
     <p>
      <b>Language Disclaimer</b><br>
      Most of the posts in this section are without words. I expect my 
      pictures to speak for themselves, in whatever language that may be ;-)
     </p>
     <p>
      If I need to add a few words of explanation, it will be in Dutch, my 
      mother tongue, since I'm from Belgium - yeah I know, please don't hold
      it against me ;-)
