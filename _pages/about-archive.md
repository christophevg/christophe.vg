title: Me, myself and I according to Christophe VG

"Passion makes the world go round." Well, in my world it really does. Lack of
passion is not something you can accuse me of and I tend to incorporate it in
everything I do. On a professional level I'm passionate about enterprise
architecture, about doing the right thing in the right way.

Professional might be an understatement, because in my not so copious spare
time I also tend to enjoy the company of my MacBooks to work on some fun
project. Most of these are available in the open through my {% include external link="http://github.com/christophevg" title="GitHub
repositories" %}.

In 2011, at the age of 37, I decided to return to full time studying at the
University of Leuven, seizing the moment to take a step back and try to find a
(professional) life that I can be even more passionate about. After about a year
it became apparant that [embedded systems](/technology) seemed to lure me their
way. The hardware world became a very important counter-part to my interest in software.

But, there is more than [computers](/technology) in my life. My daughter Eline
and son Arjen really brighten up every day of my life. [Cooking](/koken),
[digital photography](/fotografie) and [catamaran sailing](/zeilen) complete
the initial picture of my world. Each of these have their own section on this
site and contain information at various levels - mostly notes, sometimes in
depth introductions.

In this section I collect topics that add some more personal details. Some of
them are tagged "[thing](/tags/#thing)". These are small write-ups about some
_thing_ I seem to have an opinion about.

Other pages are just plain informative and/or practical.
