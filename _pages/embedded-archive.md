After more than 30 years doing (mostly administrative) software, I decided to
make a rather big switch and move into the hardware world, more specifically the
area of embedded systems.

If you're new to and interested in electronics and embedded systems, you might want to read my [first steps in electronics](FirstSteps) and my [first steps in embedded systems](Hello_Embedded_World) as a guide from nothing to something.

These two pages serve as an introduction and are basically a guided index
through most of the other pages in this section.
