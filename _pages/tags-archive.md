title: The World Tagged According to Christophe VG
permalink: /tags/
info:
  3dprinting: Many years ago I started out printing and building my own 3D printer. Over the years I'm a very happy Zortrax M200 owner and 3D printing has become a commodity - it is really a tool for me, not a focus by itself.
  arduino: Although I started with its fundamental core, the AVR-based microcontrollers, Arduino and I cross paths now and then.
  airfryer: Where have you been all my life? ;-)
  avr: The AVR architecture, by Atmel, was the first embedded platform I encountered when I entered the hardware space. A lot of my first steps involved this series of MCUs.
  fun: All work and no play makes Christophe a dull boy.
  lasercutting: Maybe the most versatile making tool a maker can own, my Beambox Pro laser cutter is one of the most used tools in my shop.
  portfolio: These pages are examples of what I spend most of my time on. It contains projects and activities, both commercial and pro-bono.
  professional: Although most of my customers require some form of professional discretion about their projects. Sometimes I can share some abstract information.
  robot: I confess, I'm a sucker for robots. Step by step I'm moving closer to the point where I'm able to design and build my very own robot.
  thing: I don't keep a blog, am not really active on so called social networks, but I sometimes feel the need to write down my very personal opinion about _things_.
  veggie: For no specific reason, by the end of 2019, I got intruiged by vegetarian cooking. For no other reason it deserves its own tag ;-)

Besides the top-level categories, I also try to add tags to the pages on this site. They tend to deal with cross-cutting concerns ;-)

{% capture site_tags %}{% for tag in site.tags %}{{ tag | first }}{% unless forloop.last %},{% endunless %}{% endfor %}{% endcapture %}
{% assign tags = site_tags | split: ',' | sort %}
 
<div id="tags">
  <strong>
    <i class="fa fa-fw fa-tags" aria-hidden="true"></i>
    {{ site.data.ui-text[site.locale].tags_label | default: "Tags:" }}
  </strong>
  <br><br>
  <span itemprop="keywords">
    {% for tag in tags %}
      <a href="#{{ tag | cgi_escape }}" class="page__taxonomy-item">
        {{ tag }}
        <span>{{ site.tags[tag].size }}</span>
      </a>
    {% endfor %}
  </span>
 
  {% for tag in tags %}
  <h2 id="{{ tag | cgi_escape }}">{{ tag }}</h2>
  {% if page.info[tag] %}{{ page.info[tag] | markdownify }}{% endif %}
  <ul class="posts">
    {% assign sorted_posts = site.tags[tag] | sort: "title" %}
    {% for post in sorted_posts %}{% if post.title != null %}
    <li><a href="{{ post.url }}">{{ post.title }}</a></li>
    {% endif %}{% endfor %}
  </ul>
  {% endfor %}
</div>
