Near the end of 1983, computers entered my life, and have never checked out. Pasionate about creating interactions with these machines, programming languages have always been my favorite topic. This love for languages evolved towards a love for [Enterprise Architecture](/About/I-Enterprise-Architect), doing the right thing with the right tools in the right way.

After roughly 30 years doing (mostly administrative) software, I decided to
take a leap and move into the hardware world, more specifically the
area of embedded systems.

If you're new to and interested in electronics and embedded systems, you might want to read my [first steps in electronics](FirstSteps) and my [first steps in embedded systems](Hello_Embedded_World) as a guide from nothing to something. These two pages serve as an introduction and are basically a guided index
through most of the other hardware-related pages in this section.

Besides hardware, this section also hosts a collection of notes on different technologies.
