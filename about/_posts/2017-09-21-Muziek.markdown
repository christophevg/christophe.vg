How can you see into my eyes like open doors?  
Leading you down into my core where I've become so numb  
Without a soul (soul), my spirit's sleeping somewhere cold  
Until you find it there and lead it back home  
  
wake me up inside  
(I can't wake up) wake me up inside  
(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark  
(Wake me up) bid my blood to run  
(I can't wake up) before I come undone  
(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Now that I know what I'm without, you can't just leave me  
Breathe into me and make me real  
Bring (bring) me (me) to life  
  
wake me up inside  
(I can't wake up) wake me up inside  
(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark  
(Wake me up) bid my blood to run  
(I can't wake up) before I come undone  
(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Bring me to life  
I've been living a lie  
There's nothing inside  
Bring me to life  
  
Frozen inside without your touch, without your love  
Darling, only you are the life among the dead  
All this time, I can't believe I couldn't see  
Kept in the dark, but you were there in front of me  
I've been sleeping a thousand years, it seems  
Got to open my eyes to everything  
Without a thought, without a voice, without a soul  
Don't let me die here, there must be something more  
Bring me to life  
  
wake me up inside  
(I can't wake up) wake me up inside  
(Save me) call my name and save me from the dark  
(Wake me up) bid my blood to run  
(I can't wake up) before I come undone  
(Save me) save me from the nothing I've become  
  
Bring me to life  
I've been living a lie (bring me to life)  
There's nothing inside  
Bring me to life
