I'll tell you something  
I am a wolf but  
I like to wear sheep's clothing  
I am a bonfire  
I am a vampire  
I'm waiting for my moment  
  
You come on like a drug  
I just can't get enough  
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more  
And there's so much at stake  
I can't afford to waste  
I've never needed anybody like this before  
  
I'll tell you something  
I am a demon  
Some say my biggest weakness  
I have my reasons  
Call it my defense  
Be careful what you're wishing  
  
You come on like a drug  
I just can't get enough  
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more  
And there's so much at stake  
I can't afford to waste  
I've never needed anybody like this before  
  
You are a secret  
A new possession  
I like to keep him guessing  
  
You come on like a drug  
I just can't get enough  
I'm like an addict coming at you for a little more  
And there's so much at stake  
I can't afford to waste  
I've never needed anybody like this before  
  
When I'm not sure what I'm living for  
When I'm not sure what I'm looking for
