Don't play with my world  
Don't mess with my mind  
Don't question my space-time  
My cosmos is mine  
  
Don't toy with my heart  
Don't knock down my shrines  
Don't alter my headlines  
My cosmos is mine  
  
No war, no war, no war  
No more, no more, no more, no more  
No fear, no fear, no fear, no fear  
Not here, not here, not here, not here  
  
No rain, no clouds  
No pain, no shrouds  
No final breaths  
No senseless deaths  
  
Don't stare at my soul  
I swear it is fine (don't mess with my mind)  
Its borders are outlined (don't question my space-time)  
My cosmos is mine (my cosmos is mine)  
My cosmos is mine  
  
My cosmos is mine (don't play with my world)  
My cosmos is mine (don't mess with my mind)  
My cosmos is mine (don't question my space-time)  
My cosmos is mine
