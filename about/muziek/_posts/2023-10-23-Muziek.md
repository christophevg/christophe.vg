  (<i>Forever wondering if you were that one person, S.</i>)
</span>

He was not as tall and rather fat  
He had a labrador and a lumping cat  
Born in a country with a broken heart  
He had enough money and a credit card  
  
Told bedtime stories to his Teddybear  
Gave him lots of hugs and a dress to wear  
He had a small apartment (what a lovely sight)  
He watched MTV all night  
  
Where the hell was friendship  
He must have turned it off  
And most of all he wondered what is love  
What the hell is love  
  
He enjoyed the silence more and more  
As he heard the door slam right next door  
He had a fancy Parker and a diary  
In which he wrote some poetry  
  
And as he went to bed at night  
The cat's eyes gave him ample light  
To make him lie awake and see  
The content of his misery  
  
Where the hell was friendship  
He must have turned it off  
And most of all he wondered what is love  
What the hell is love  
  
Where the hell was friendship  
He must have turned it off  
And most of all he wondered what is love  
What the hell is love
