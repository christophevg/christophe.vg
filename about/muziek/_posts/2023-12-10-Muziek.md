Some people get by with a little understanding  
Some people get by with a whole lot more  
I don't know, why you gotta be so undemanding  
One thing I know, I want more, I want more  
  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
D'you get scared to feel so much?  
To let somebody touch you?  
So hot, so cold, so far so out of control  
Hard to come by, and harder to hold  
  
Some people get by with a little understanding  
Some people get by with a whole lot more  
I don't know, why you gotta be so undemanding  
I want more  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
There are parts of me that don't get nervous  
Not the parts that shake  
You won't get what you deserve  
You are what you take  
  
Learning to cry for fun and profit  
I'm not done yet  
Counterfeit dollars or the English Zloty  
Anything I can get  
  
Some people get by with a little understanding  
Some people get by with a whole lot more  
I don't know, why you gotta be so undemanding  
One thing I know, I want more  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
And I need all the love I can get  
And I need all the love that I can't get too  
  
Can't get to  
And I need all the love  
That you can guess?
