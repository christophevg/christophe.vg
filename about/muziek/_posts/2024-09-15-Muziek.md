Your blades are sharpened with precision  
Flashing your favorite point of view  
I know you're waiting in the distance  
Just like you always do  
Just like you always do  
  
Already pulling me in  
Already under my skin  
And I know exactly how this ends, I  
  
Let you cut me open  
Just to watch me bleed  
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be  
Don't know why I'm hoping  
For what I won't receive  
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine  
The emptiness machine  
  
Going around like a revolver  
It's been decided how we lose  
'Cause there's a fire under the altar  
I keep on lying to  
I keep on lying to  
  
Already pulling me in  
Already under my skin  
And I know exactly how this ends, I  
  
Let you cut me open  
Just to watch me bleed  
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be  
Don't know why I'm hoping  
For what I won't receive  
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine  
  
I only wanted to be part of something  
I only wanted to be part of, part of  
I only wanted to be part of something  
I only wanted to be part of, part of  
I only wanted to be part of something  
I only wanted to be part  
  
I let you cut me open  
Just to watch me bleed  
Gave up who I am for who you wanted me to be  
Don't know why I'm hoping  
So fucking naive  
Falling for the promise of the emptiness machine  
The emptiness machine  
(I only wanted to be part of something)  
The emptiness machine  
(I only wanted to be part of)  
The emptiness machine
