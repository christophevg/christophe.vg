Usually, I donâ€™t add context or an introduction, especially not a reason why a song holds a special meaning for me. But this one does.

When I first heard this song around 2020, I immediately envisioned the music video: a sunset over a festival ground with slowly moving shadowed people vibing to the music. That was the feeling the song gave me at that moment. Every year since, as I start counting down the days to Rock Wechter, this image and the song resurface. So it should have been included here a long time ago.

And before you ask, yes, I eventually saw the actual video, which is completely different. I also listened to the lyrics. Some people say that the lyrics must have resonated with me. They might be partially correct. ðŸ˜‡

It's a long, lonely road  
That I've walked on my own  
Never thought I'd end up in this place (ooh-ooh)  
I went fast, I went slow  
Then I gave up all hope  
'Cause I know, either way, it's the same (ooh-ooh)  
  
And I'm not tryna find somebody  
'Cause no one else but you will do (ooh-ooh)  
Yeah, the real thing is gone  
Now I wish I could hold you  
  
I wasted all of these days and nights  
Trying to chase all these empty highs  
But I had to go through my worse so I know that I just needed you (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
As I look out at the morning sun  
There's no escape from the things I've done  
And out of everything I've lost, now I know that I just needed you (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
And darling, that's the truth (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
  
I don't lie anymore  
In a heap on the floor  
'Cause I'm clear on the road I must take (ooh-ooh)  
  
And I'm not tryna find somebody  
'Cause no one else but you will do (ooh-ooh)  
I'm getting close, I'm stumbling over everything I need to say to you  
  
I wasted all of these days and nights  
Trying to chase all these empty highs  
But I had to go through my worse so I know that I just needed you (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
As I look out at the morning sun  
There's no escape from the things I've done  
And out of everything I've lost, now I know that I just needed you (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
And darling, that's the truth (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
And darling, that's the truth (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
  
I was searching, every fiber  
If you're out there, leave a light on  
'Cause the distance is getting wider  
And I know I've gotta find ya  
  
I wasted all of these days and nights  
Trying to chase all these empty highs  
But I had to go through my worse so I know that I just needed you (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
As I look out at the morning sun  
There's no escape from the things I've done  
And out of everything I've lost, now I know that I just needed you (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
And darling, that's the truth (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
And darling, that's the truth (oh-oh-oh-oh)  
And darling, that's the truth
