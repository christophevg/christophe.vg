Oh, oh, and I  

I put a wish in  

Made it my mission  

To end the conflict  

But oh  

I put a wish in  

Hoping you'd listen  

Be my accomplice  

But ohhh  

Relax, it's only dreaming facts  
Giving way to feelings  
No one ever stays long  
It's over when you wake up  
So I knew that it was  

In the picture perfect world  
We can be more than before  

I said it was  
I made it stronger  

From the beginning  
My head was spinning  
The perfect star  

Oh a church  
A place to fit in  

A new religion  

I found your heart  

But oh oh  

Relax, it's only dreaming facts  
Giving way to feelings  
No one ever stays long  
It's over when you wake up  

So I knew that it was  

In the picture perfect world  
We can be more than before  

I said it was  
I made it stronger  

In the picture perfect world  
We can be more than before  
I said it was  
I made it stronger  

Don't get mad  
You did your best  
And now it's  
All in the past to stay  
So I knew that it was  

In the picture perfect world  
We can be more than before  

I said it was  
I made it stronger  
In the picture perfect world  
We can be more than before  

I said it was  
I made it stronger
