We're talking away  
I don't know what I'm to say  
I'll say it anyway  
Today is another day to find you  
Shyin' away  
Oh, I'll be comin' for your love, okay  
  
Take on me  
(Take on me)  
Take me on  
(Take on me)  
I'll be gone  
In a day or two  
  
So needless to say  
I'm odds and ends  
But I'll be stumblin' away  
Slowly learnin' that life is okay  
Say after me  
It's no better to be safe than sorry  
  
Take on me  
(Take on me)  
Take me on  
(Take on me)  
I'll be gone  
In a day or two  
  
All the things that you say, yeah  
Is it life or just to play my worries away?  
You're all the things I've got to remember  
You're shyin' away  
I'll be comin' for you anyway  
  
Take on me  
(Take on me)  
Take me on  
(Take on me)  
I'll be gone  
In a day  
(Take on me)  
(Take on me)  
(Take me on)  
(Take on me)  
I'll be gone  
(Take on me)  
In a day  
(Take me on)  
(Take on me)  
(Take on me)  
(Take on me)  
(Take me on)  
(Take on me)
