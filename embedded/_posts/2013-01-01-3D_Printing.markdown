title: 3D Printing
---

Beginning 2013, I decided to jump onto the 3D printing train and built a
[Printrbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Printrbot) at a workshop hosted by
[3D Parts](http://3dparts.be).

On this page I collect my experiences, problems and solutions, as well as the
modifications I make while solving problems and making improvements.

This page is under the section [Embedded](./) because of its close relationship
to hardware and embedded systems. One of my goals is to create an embedded
system to replace the
[printerboard](http://makemendel.com/electronics-parts/printrboard) - or at
least create and addon - to remotely manage printing (which happens at my
garage).

## The Beginning

Although quiet a few of my fellow technology addicts have been involved in 3D
Printing for some time, I waited until the moment that 3 months in a row I
caught myself thinking "If I only had a 3D Printer now I could ...".

By February 2013 I reached that moment and decided to build one. Having seen
pretty nice results (given the associated price tag) from the
[Printrbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Printrbot) that was sold and build by
[3D Parts](http://3dparts.be), I went for it and registered for one of the
workshops. 

Below is a Flickr slideshow of that workshop up to the point where I installed
it at home in my garage and started printing my first prints.

## Prints

Although this list will soon be out-dated, I'm going to try and keep a list of
things I print. Most of them come from
[Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com), some of them are own creations,
some of which should also be uploaded to Thingiverse :-)

* [Naked Woman Shooter Glass](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15012)  
This is a very nice introduction to show what is possible with 3D printing.  
V = 16.7 cm<sup>3</sup>

* Bumba Cookie Cutter  
First experiment with custom shapes.  
V = 6.4 cm<sup>3</sup>

* [Wallace++ components](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45207) (failed and complete set)  
My printrbot is nice, but it can be improved. This Wallace++ modification gives
it a much more solid base and the horizontally mounted X-axis should also
improve its general stability.  
V = 2x 75.2 cm<sup>3</sup> + 38.7 cm<sup>3</sup> + 41.8 cm<sup>3</sup> + 19.3
cm<sup>3</sup> + 7.9 cm<sup>3</sup> + 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup> + 3x 1.9
cm<sup>3</sup> = 266.3 cm<sup>3</sup>

* a replacement terminator for a tent pole  
After the first time playing with their new toy tents, a tent pole terminator
was lost in action. My wife suggested I try to print a replacement. With only a
simple ruler it was a 10 minute job. First real home-improvement success :-)  
V = 0.6 cm<sup>3</sup>

* keychain-style experiments with a beautiful names.
To experiment with infilling and various other parameters, I tried a rather
difficult shape: the name of my daughter. Not much later, she asked me to do
one for her best friend's birthday party.
V = 1.8 cm<sup>3</sup>, V = 4.2 cm<sup>3</sup> and V = 4.4 cm<sup>3</sup>

I try to take pictures of every print and add them to my [3D prints
set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophevg/sets/72157633850208383/)

## Problems

3D Printing at home (at this price tag at least) is not (yet) simply setting up
and go. It's a bit of a craft and requires a lot of love.

In the weeks following my workshop I encountered a lot of problems. But, having
built the printer myself, I was also able to track down the source and fix it.

* Tilted extruder  
Apparently I didn't tighten the screws of my extruder will enough and it was no
longer nicely perpendicular to my plate. This caused very bad prints, but once
solved did improve the prints _a lot_.

* Loose screw on extruder servo gear  
After a few prints my X-axis suddenly stopped working. The small screw that
keeps the gear in place had come loose, making the motor spin with no effect.
Remember to check and tighten that screw from time to time.

* Blocked large extruder gear  
The large gear that drives the filament into the extruder had become blocked.
Adding two big washers between it and the extruder mount solved that one.

* Too little tension on belts driving the axis  
From time to time and more and more, my prints suddenly shifted along the X-
and Y-axis, causing kind of a staircase effect. After searching a bit on the
net, I found out that the cause could be that there wasn't enough tension on
the belts. And indeed, putting a lot more tension on them solved this problem.

* Loose screws on X-axis servo mount  
I still had problems with a lot of vertical _wobble_. I initially though it was
due to the Z-axis, until I discovered that my Y-axis servo motor was not firmly
connected to its mount. Adding a nut to remove the spacing resulted in a firmly
mounted servo motor, but suddenly also reasonably good prints.

## Changes

Having built the printer myself, I'm also able to modify it. There are many
people out there experimenting with new designs, so there are a lot of sources
to learn from.

### Transformation into a Wallace++

Our workshop at [3D Parts](http://3dparts.be) was the last one that produced
pretty standard a [Printrbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Printrbot). After
that, Stefaan decided to go for an improved model: the
[Wallace++](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45207).

During the first weeks, I _used_ the components needed to assemble a Wallace++,
to get to know my printer and tighten a lot of loose screws and belts.

With all components ready now, I'm soon going to upgrade my printer. To be
continued.

## Welcome to my 3D Hub

By the end of May, I was the tenth registered [3D printing
hub](http://3dhubs.com/antwerp/hubs/christophe) in Antwerp on [3D
Hubs](http://3dhubs.com). Which basically means I'm willing to welcome you in
my garage to print your 3D design. And to make it perfectly clear ... I'm not
interested in [printing
guns](https://plus.google.com/109420283197516932948/posts/2z1qQubD8fV).

## Future

3D Printing in itself is nice, but it's also a testbed for me to try out new
stuff. Being stocked by [embedded systems](./) I'm starting to assemble a wish
list of things I want to build around this printer.

* Build a remote-print-manager system
