title: 3D Printing
---

Beginning 2013, I decided to jump onto the 3D printing train and built a
[Printrbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Printrbot) at a workshop hosted by
[3D Parts](http://3dparts.be).

On this page I collect my experiences, problems and solutions, as well as the
modifications I make while solving problems and making improvements.

This page is under the section [Embedded](./) because of its close relationship
to hardware and embedded systems. One of my goals is to create an embedded
system to replace the
[printerboard](http://makemendel.com/electronics-parts/printrboard) - or at
least create and addon - to remotely manage printing (which happens at my
garage).

## The Beginning

Although quiet a few of my fellow technology addicts have been involved in 3D
Printing for some time, I waited until the moment that 3 months in a row I
caught myself thinking "If I only had a 3D Printer now I could ...".

By February 2013 I reached that moment and decided to build one. Having seen
pretty nice results (given the associated price tag) from the
[Printrbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Printrbot) that was sold and build by
[3D Parts](http://3dparts.be), I went for it and registered for one of the
workshops. 

Below is a Flickr slideshow of that workshop up to the point where I installed
it at home in my garage and started printing my first prints.

## Prints

Although this list will soon be out-dated, I'm going to try and keep a list of
things I print. Most of them come from
[Thingiverse](http://www.thingiverse.com), some of them are own creations,
some of which should also be uploaded to Thingiverse :-)

* [Naked Woman Shooter Glass](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:15012)  
This is a very nice introduction to show what is possible with 3D printing.  
V = 16.7 cm<sup>3</sup>

* Bumba Cookie Cutter  
First experiment with custom shapes.  
V = 6.4 cm<sup>3</sup>

* [Wallace++ components](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45207) (failed and complete set)  
My printrbot is nice, but it can be improved. This Wallace++ modification gives
it a much more solid base and the horizontally mounted X-axis should also
improve its general stability.  
V = 2x 75.2 cm<sup>3</sup> + 38.7 cm<sup>3</sup> + 41.8 cm<sup>3</sup> + 19.3
cm<sup>3</sup> + 7.9 cm<sup>3</sup> + 2.5 cm<sup>3</sup> + 3x 1.9
cm<sup>3</sup> = 266.3 cm<sup>3</sup>

* a replacement terminator for a tent pole  
After the first time playing with their new toy tents, a tent pole terminator
was lost in action. My wife suggested I try to print a replacement. With only a
simple ruler it was a 10 minute job. First real home-improvement success :-)  
V = 0.6 cm<sup>3</sup>

* keychain-style experiments with a beautiful name  
To experiment with infilling and various other parameters, I tried a rather
difficult shape: the name of my daughter.  
V = 1.8 cm<sup>3</sup>

I try to take pictures of every print and add them to my [3D prints
set on Flickr](http://www.flickr.com/photos/christophevg/sets/72157633850208383/)

## Problems

3D Printing at home (at this price tag at least) is not (yet) simply setting up
and go. It's a bit of a craft and requires a lot of love.

In the weeks following my workshop I encountered a lot of problems. Having
built the printer myself, I was also able to track down the source and fix it.

* Tilted extruder
* Loose screw on extruder servo gear
* Blocked large extruder gear
* Too little tension on belts driving the axis
* Loose screws on X-axis servo mount

## Changes

Having built the printer myself, I'm also able to modify it. There are many
people out there experimenting with new designs, so there are a lot of sources
to learn from.

### Transformation into a Wallace++

Our workshop at [3D Parts](http://3dparts.be) was the last one that produced
pretty standard a [Printrbot](http://www.reprap.org/wiki/Printrbot). After
that, Stefaan decided to go for an improved model: the
[Wallace++](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:45207).

During the first weeks, I _used_ the components needed to assemble a Wallace++,
to get to know my printer and tighten a lot of loose screws and belts.

With all components ready now, I'm soon going to upgrade my printer. To be
continued.

## Welcome to my 3D Hub

By the end of May, I was the tenth registered [3D printing
hub](http://3dhubs.com/antwerp/hubs/christophe) in Antwerp on [3D
Hubs](http://3dhubs.com). Which basically means I'm willing to welcome you in
my garage to print your 3D design. And to make it perfectly clear ... I'm not
interested in [printing
guns](https://plus.google.com/109420283197516932948/posts/2z1qQubD8fV).

## Future

3D Printing in itself is nice, but it's also a testbed for me to try out new
stuff. Being stocked by [embedded systems](./) I'm starting to assemble a wish
list of things I want to build around this printer.

* Build a remote-print-manager system
