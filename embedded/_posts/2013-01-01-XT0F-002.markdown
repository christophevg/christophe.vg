title: XT0F-002 - Programmer
---

XT0F-002 is a programmer for a 24-pin [ATMEGA8 MCU](ATMEGA168.html). It allows
you to to connect the [ISP](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-System_Programming)
(In System Programmer) to the MCU's
[SPI](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus).

## Revision 1

I use a [JTAGICE mkII](JTAGICE_mkII.html), which has a JTAG interface. ISP only
uses 6 wires, but I include a full JTAG male connector which allows me to
directly connect the JTAGICE.

The implementation is mainly a direct implementation of the [programming
circuit for the ATMEGA8](ATMEGA168.html). Of course, I reuse the
[XT0F-001](XT0F-001.html) to include a rock-stable 5V power supply.

In this revision, I've also included 4 LEDs to allow an MCU to do basic visual
checks. ADC pins 5 through 2 are provided.
