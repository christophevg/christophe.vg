title: XT0F Family
---

After diving into the electronics world for some weeks, I felt the need/urge to
create reusable components - much as I was used to in the software world. Just
for fun, I decided to give them a name and group them as a family.

And so I created the XT0F family of components:

### Family Members

* [XT0F-001](XT0F-001.html) is the elementary first component every project
  needs: a regulated power supply.
* [XT0F-002](XT0F-002.html) is my self-compiled ISP-over-JTAG-SPI programmer
  for the [ATMEGA8](ATMEGA168.html) family of MCU's that I'm initially
  focussing on.
* [XT0F-003](XT0F-003.html) is my first home-grown wireless sensor node - short
  mote.

### Family Ties

Besides boxing all components as much as possible using custom 3D printed
cases, I also try to make connections between the components in a consistent
way. Most members can be connected to each other through header-based
connectors.

For example: [XT0F-001](XT0F-001.html) can be plugged onto
[XT0F-002](XT0F-002.html), but can also be plugged onto a breadboard.
