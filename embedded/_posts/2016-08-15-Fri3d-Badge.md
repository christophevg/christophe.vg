In 2014 [Anthony](http://anthony.liekens.net) and I hacked together the first edition of [Fri3d Camp](http://fri3d.be), a family-friendly hacker camp. Two years later, we did it again, now with a team of 8 great, like-minded souls. Besides being in charge of organising the content, I also took on the job to design and produce a custom Arduino badge for every one of the 299+1 attendees.

> **Kudos**  
> A big round of applause goes out to everyone who helped me make this the success it was: the entire Fri3d orga team, FabLab Brussels, Yannick, Maarten, Dragan,...

# Nothing to See here ;-)

All information on the Fri3d Badge, can be found in other locations around the web:

## Design Files

I've documented (well, still have to complete some of it) every step in the design and production of the badge in a [Github repository](https://github.com/Fri3dCamp/badge). It includes all design files, but also a [diary](https://github.com/Fri3dCamp/badge/blob/master/design/dagboek.md).

## Presentation

At [Fri3d Camp](http://fri3d.be), I also gave a small talk to give the attendees a glimpse of all the work we put into designing and producing this badge for all 299+1 attendees. The slides can be found on [Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/christophevg/fri3d-badge).
