EZRPi is a Raspberry Pi HAT with a Silicon Labs EZR32 Sub-GHz MCU. Using the EZRPi HAT one can have access to sub-GHz network protocols on a Raspberry Pi. 

An example of such protocol is Dash-7. Dash7 is a specification for an ultra low power network stack, operating within the sub-GHz spectrum. The [Dash7 Open Source Stack (OSS-7)](https://github.com/MOSAIC-LoPoW/dash7-ap-open-source-stack) can be flashed onto the EZR to turn it into a modem, accessible from the Raspberry Pi. On the Pi, one then could talk to this modem using [pyd7a](https://github.com/MOSAIC-LoPoW/pyd7a) a collection of Python modules, supporting the DASH7 Alliance Protocol in general, and OSS-7 in particular..

While [a GitHub repository](https://github.com/christophevg/EZRpi) contains all design and implementation source files of this generic sub-GHz Raspberry Pi HAT, on this page, I'm collecting overview & background information on the project, links to useful resources, remarks, wishes, angry screams,...

## Rationale

Having been working in to IoT space for almost three years now and being in love with creating new embedded devices for about two more years, I've already witnessed an incredible evolution. Every _thing_ is becoming connected, causing the WiFi space to become more and more _crowded_.

At certain locations the amount of wireless communication in the gigahertz range causes the network to become unreliable and even unusable for critical applications. People are looking at different solutions to get around this growing issue, looking for new _backbones_ for the ever increasing need for wireless communication.

As I've learned over the past years, the sub-GHz range of wireless communication might be a solution. While "classic" usage wants faster networks, for which people are looking at 5GHz, a great deal of applications don't require the vast amounts of data to be transmitted and rather require small amounts of data to be communicated. Certainly in the IoT space, where _users_ are small devices with no video-streaming or other heavy downloading needs, looking at a slower, but possibly more reliable network might ben a good solution to overcome the over-crowding of the _human_ space.

Sub-GHz network protocols, like Dash7, Z-Wave, SigFox, LoRaWAN,... offer lower data rates, but offer much longer range communication at much lower power costs. So besides not competing for _space_ in the 2.4 or 5 GHz frequency range, they come with additional bonus value.

Currently several break-out boards are popping up on the market, offering access to many of the mentioned networks. Still in its infancy, they all come with pros and cons, but most of the time all require an environment specific to their implementation in one way or the other. And although developing a network stack is surely not for the faint-of-heart, the underlying basics are doable for enthousiasts.

The EZR32 by Silicon Labs is a microcontroller with a sub-GHz transceiver in a single package. It has everything on board to start talking and listening in this sub-GHz space.

With this project I want to create a generic solution to bring the sub-GHz range to Raspberry Pi, without focussing on one specific network stack.

With the EZR32 operating as a modem to the Raspberry Pi, the complexity of the network stack can be _hidden_ on the EZR, while using the network can be as simple as `send "hello world"`.

Although this project is indifferent about network-technology, two demo implementations will be provided: the Dash7 Open Source Stack provides out-of-the box functionality to make the EZR32 operate as a modem, accessible through an `AT`-command set.

On the other hand, I want to implement a minimal and ultra-basic network "stack" to illustrate what is really needed to be able to make devices _talk_.

We'll see where this leads me :-)

## Version 1

The production of the first version of the board is currently ongoing. The design includes a standard 868MHz setup of the EZR32 and two LEDs for minimal debugging/feedback.

The board is a 2-layer PCB based on the official Raspberry Pi HAT board specification.

Within a few weeks both the components and prototype PCBs will be available and ready for (manual) soldering and testing.
