title: eID notes
---

If you live in Belgium and want to use your eID on Mac OS X, things aren't all
that nice.

  <b>NOTE</b>
  <br><br>

  My notes are sometimes outdated. Currently the development of an Open Source
  software package for the Belgian eID is maintained by the great people at <a
  href="http://www.linuxbe.com">Linux Belgium</a>. I haven't tested it, but
  they say - and I'm willing to believe them - that the installation
  instructions provided at <a
  href="http://eid.belgium.be/nl/je_eid_gebruiken/de_eid-middleware_installeren/
  ">http://eid.belgium.be/nl/je_eid_gebruiken/de_eid-middleware_installeren/</a>
   should provide you with a single-install solution.

  If not ... continue on reading and blame Jasper ;-)

## Keychain/Safari Integration

As of Mac OS X 10.7 things got even worst due to the removal of the
previously included BELPIC Tokend. This now needs to be installed manually.

These three steps have recently been succesful at getting an ACR28 cardreader
(the one handed out by the Belgian government) to authenticate Safari.

### Step 1: install driver

Visit the manufacturer's website and download the latest driver. In case of the
ACR38 it is
[http://www.acs.com.hk/index.php?pid=drivers&id=ACR38](http://www.acs.com.hk/ind
ex.php?pid=drivers&id=ACR38).

Validate that it works by plugging in the reader and inserting your card. The
light on the reader should stop blinking an be on all the time - indicating
your card was read and accepted.


### Step 2: Install Tokend voor BELPIC

As of Mac OS X 10.7 the Tokend's for several cards are no longer shipped. They
are downloadable from MacOSForge. 
[http://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/installers](http://smartcardservices.macosforge.org/trac/wiki/installers)
Download and install (at least) the BELPIC Tokend.

Validate that it works by opening your Keychain Access app and see that you
card is added to the list of keychains.

### Step 3:  Test it ...

Visit [https://test.eid.belgium.be](https://test.eid.belgium.be) and test your
setup.
