title: Jekyll Notes
---

When I started moving all of my domains from my co-located hosts into the
cloud, I needed a way to keep alive a few websites I own - like this one.
Before solving that problem, I already had moved all my repositories to
[GitHub](http://github.com) and one of the requirements therefore was that I
wanted to be able to simply push and see my sites online.

[GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) seemed a nice initial solution. It only
offers hosting for static pages, but they provide support for
[Jekyll](https://github.com/mojombo/jekyll), a static site generator.

Although far from ideal, it currently allows me to maintain most of my sites,
without the need for any fancy CMS.

## Installation

environment.
