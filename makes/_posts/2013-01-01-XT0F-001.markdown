XT0F-001 is a an implementation of the [regulated power
supply](Regulated_Voltage.html). Initially it provides 5V, but I intend to add
support for the 3V circuit also.

## Revision 1

The first revision is a basic, straight-forward implementation of the
breadboard design of my [regulated power supply](Regulated_Voltage.html)

The power-supply barrel connector and the switch are connected using wires and
are not mounted on the prototype board and will be incorporated into the casing.

On the right two female headers are mounted in a 90 degree angle, providing a
socket-style connector for other designs.

### Status

Needs to be implemented :-)
