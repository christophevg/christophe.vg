XT0F-002 is a programmer for a 24-pin [ATMEGA8 MCU](/technology/ATMEGA168). It allows
you to to connect the {% include external link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-System_Programming" title="ISP" %}
(In System Programmer) to the MCU's
{% include external link="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Serial_Peripheral_Interface_Bus" title="SPI" %}

## Revision 1

I use a [JTAGICE mkII](/technology/JTAGICE_mkII), which has a JTAG interface. ISP only
uses 6 wires, but I include a full JTAG male connector which allows me to
directly connect the JTAGICE.

The implementation is mainly a direct implementation of the [programming
circuit for the ATMEGA8](/technology/ATMEGA168). Of course, I reuse the
[XT0F-001](XT0F-001) to include a rock-stable 5V power supply.

### Circuit

In this revision, I've also included 4 LEDs to allow an MCU to do basic visual
checks. ADC pins 5 through 2 are provided.

### Status

Implementation in progress :-)
