In 2014 {% include external link="http://anthony.liekens.net" title="Anthony" %} and I hacked together the first edition of [Fri3d Camp](/about/Fri3d_Camp), a family-friendly hacker camp. Two years later, we did it again, now with a team of 8 great, like-minded souls. Besides being in charge of organising the content, I also took on the job to design and produce a custom Arduino badge for every one of the 299+1 attendees.

> **Kudos**  
> A big round of applause goes out to everyone who helped me make this the success it was: the entire Fri3d orga team, FabLab Brussels, Yannick, Maarten, Dragan,...

# Nothing to See here ;-)

All information on the Fri3d Badge, can be found in other locations around the web:

## Design Files

I've documented (well, still have to complete some of it) every step in the design and production of the badge in a {% include external link="https://github.com/christophevg/Fri3dBadge2016" title="Github repository" %}. It includes all design files.
