A few weeks after having made a [Padel Racket for Mark](Padel-racket), my son Arjen had to dress up as a {% include external link="https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/" title="Man in Black" %}. Building the racket was a first attempt at working with EVA foam, now I was ready for something more challenging üôÑ

### Inspiration / Credits

{% include video name="kamui-mandalorian" kind="png" id="9NntQbGUWdo" title="I built the Mandalorian STAR WARS Rifle out of EVA FOAM!" %}

My interest in EVA foam and prop making was triggered by the incredible cosplay builds by {% include external link="https://www.kamuicosplay.com" title="Svetlana from KamuiCosplay" %}. Especially her build of the Mandalorian Sniper Rifle, which has been on my bucketlist ever since.

## Constructing the {% include external link="https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Series_4_De-Atomizer" title="Series 4 De-Atomizer" %}

So of course I couldn't come up with a simple prop... of course it had to be one that is hard to find good pictures of, is a complex construction of many different parts and has to look shiny all over.

Yep, it had to be the Series 4 De-Atomizer üòá

The process was "basically" the same as with the Padel Racket, just a little more elaborate and complex.

### Making Plans

{% include thumbs show="reference" %}

From some pictures online, I constructed a print-out template to use as blue-print of the top and side of the gun - and you gotta use what works... printing them from Numbers, allowed me to span it acros multiple pages and print it to scale ü´£

{% include thumbs show="3d-model" %}

I had to come up with many 2D-to-3D-puzzles to combine basic shapes into a construction that immitated the original. While doing so, I modelled many parts in Fusion, until in the end I even had a complete 3D model of the gun.

{% include thumbs show="cuts,3d-prints" %}

This allowed me to make many projections and section cuts to have clean 2D vector images and 3D surface models to feed into my laser cutter and/or 3D printer.

### Cutting and Printing and Glueing and Sanding...

So, I again cut many pieces of EVA foam with my laser cutter, glued them together and sanded them to come up with a nice curvy look. Some smaller parts were 3D printed and had a layer of EVA foam clay added to make them more like the other parts.

After the entire gun was assembled, I again applied a coat of Plasti Dip to give it a more metal look 'n feel. The black is also the perfect and required base coat for the top-coat of silver shiny metal-like airbrush paint.

Some additional (real) screws and other wooden and plastic details added the final finishing touches.

> In the end my son was very happy with the end-result - and to this date it is still my most elaborate EVA foam prop making project. If I had had more time, I would have redone the final coatings and first applied the foam clay also to the flat EVA foam parts. Now these parts have different feel and look more "porous" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
