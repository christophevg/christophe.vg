A few weeks after having made a [Padel Racket for Mark](Padel-racket), my son Arjen had to dress up as a "[Man in Black](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0119654/)". Building the racket was a first attempt at working with EVA foam, now I was ready for something more challenging üôÑ

### Inspiration / Credits

{% include video name="kamui-mandalorian" kind="png" id="9NntQbGUWdo" title="I built the Mandalorian STAR WARS Rifle out of EVA FOAM!" %}

My interest in EVA foam and prop making was triggered by the incredible cosplay builds by <a href="https://www.kamuicosplay.com" target="_blank">Svetlana from KamuiCosplay</a>. Especially her build of the Mandalorian Sniper Rifle, which has been on my bucketlist ever since.

## Constructing the [Series 4 De-Atomizer](https://meninblack.fandom.com/wiki/Series_4_De-Atomizer)

So of course I couldn't come up with a simple prop... of course it had to be one that is hard to find good pictures of, is a complex construction of many different parts and has to look shiny all over.

Yep, it had to be the Series 4 De-Atomizer üòá

The process was "basically" the same as with the Padel Racket, just a little more elaborate and complex.

From some pictures online, I constructed a print-out template to use as blue-print. I had to come up with many 3D-puzzles to combine basic shapes into a construction that immitated the original.

So, I again cut many pieces of EVA foam with my laser cutter, glued them together and sanded them to come up with a nice curvy look. Some smaller parts were 3D printed and had a layer of EVA foam clay added to make them more like the other parts.

After the entire gun was assembled, I again applied a coat of Plasti Dip to give it a more metal look 'n feel. The black is also the perfect and required base coat for the top-coat of silver shiny metal-like airbrush paint.

Some additional (real) screws and other wooden and plastic details added the final finishing touches.

In the end my son was very happy with the end-result - and to this date it is still my most elaborate EVA foam prop making project. If I had had more time, I would have redone the final coatings and first applied the foam clay also to the flat EVA foam parts. Now these parts have different feel and look more "porous" ü§∑‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
