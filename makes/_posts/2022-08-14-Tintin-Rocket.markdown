I really can't say why I am also so facinated by the famous Tintin Rocket. Maybe I've never been very outspoken about it, still whenever I'm confronted with it, it really tickles my imagination, my urge to ... make one 🤓

{% include thumbs show="inspiration,printing-a-mockup" %}

My goal is to build a replica of about 1m50-ish. Now everything starts small, with a 3D model and a printed version...

This is going to be a very long build, with a lot to learn, so let's clearly mark this as: WORK IN PROGRESS
