My son, like many sons (and daughters) loves Minecraft. He especially likes the {% include external link="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Enderman" title="Enderman" %}. When he wanted to use the character as a base for a school project, but couldn't find a model to start from, we started brainstorming.

It didn't take long before he came up with the idea to start from six simple boxes - for which you can find {% include external link="https://boxes.hackerspace-bamberg.de" title="great generators online" %} - and combine those into an Enderman figure.

Based on a reference visual from an Enderman toy, we came up with dimensions for the different pieces: The head (in cm) 8x8x8, body 8x6x12, arm 2x2x29 and leg 2x2x23. In no time all 4 boxes were ready to be cut and assembled.

After importing all pieces into Inkscape and adding some support for assembling the boxes, an initial design was ready in very little time.

The toy also had an additional base on which the figure could be placed, and keep it upright, since it has very long and thin legs with a lot of weight on top. With another box, and some Inkscape loving, we also finished had that ready to be cut.

## Sharing is Caring

All files to construct it yourself are available on Thingiverse:  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6781339](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6781339). If you want more, all files used to construct this make, are also found in their own {% include external link="https://github.com/christophevg/enderman" title="git repository on GitHub" %}.

{% include thumbs show="pins" %}

A laser-cut solution to attach the head to the body is included. To attach the arms to the body, a 6mm wooden plug will do the trick. While this works, I like to use a 3D printed pin that keeps both parts nice and tightly together:  That "Snap Together Pin" is also found on Thingiverse:  [https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6781058](https://www.thingiverse.com/thing:6781058)

## The Final Result

After testing it with MDF, we also cut the base in plexi, which adds a nice touch.
