It doesn’t always require [rocket science](Tintin Rocket) to make a gift more personal. Sometimes, a little attention to the wrapping can make all the difference.

I happen to have a friend who is absolutely obsessed with Halloween. She has more Halloween decorations than all Belgian amusement parks combined. No, I’m not exaggerating! 🎃

When she organized a Halloween party at her house this year, I couldn’t resist bringing a gift. Over the past few years, I’ve regularly been making personalized and custom gift wrapping on several occasions. So, what better gift than a coffin for a Halloween party present?! 💀

## Instructables to the Rescue

Due to professional and other occupations, I don’t have much time these days, so I turned to Google and found a {% include external link="https://www.instructables.com/Laser-Cut-and-Engraved-Coffin" title="laser-cut and engraved coffin on Instructables" %}. It seemed like a great start.

However, after cutting the design as is, it turned out that it wasn’t quite perfect. The sides didn't align properly. Nothing a little bit of Inkscape couldn't solve 🤓

## Inkscape to the Rescue

Because sharing is caring, I’m sharing my improved SVG file below. Once you cut and glue it together, you’ll have half of a coffin. Repeat the process and add some hinges, and you’ll be ready to personalize your coffin gift box 😇 I opted for a Celtic Cross engraved on top. If I had more time, I’d love to hand-paint some {% include google search="vibrant dia del morte designs" image="yes" %} on it.

The design is large enough to fit a bottle or several bags of candy.

Happy Halloween!
