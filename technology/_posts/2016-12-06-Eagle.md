I started using {% include external link="https://cadsoft.io" title="Eagle" %} when I designed the [Fri3d Camp badge](Fri3d-Badge), my first solo-SMD project. This section is devoted to my notes on learning and using it.

# Eagle?

Eagle is (still) the de facto standard in PCB design, although there are some other applications that seem very promising. I would really love to try out {% include external link="http://circuitmaker.com" title="Altium Circuitmaker" %}, but - for now - it's still Windows-only and running it in a VM just doesn't cut it. So for now, I'm a happy Eagle user. Once they release a MacOS version ... they have an Eagle importer ;-)

# Resources

I don't intend to create a complete tutorial and/or documentation. There are so many great pages around the internet. Below is the selection I used to learn Eagle and that I refer back to when things _slip_ my mind ;-)

# Libraries

Having a good set of Eagle part libraries is key to success. Besides the standard libraries, there are some additional libraries that shouldn't be missing from your collection.

* {% include external link="https://cadsoft.io/resources/libraries/" title="https://cadsoft.io/resources/libraries/" %}
* {% include external link="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library" title="https://github.com/adafruit/Adafruit-Eagle-Library" %}
* {% include external link="https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries" title="https://github.com/sparkfun/SparkFun-Eagle-Libraries" %}
* {% include external link="https://www.element14.com/community/community/cadsoft_eagle/blog/2015/01/15/the-10-most-popular-cadsoft-eagle-libraries" title="https://www.element14.com/community/community/cadsoft_eagle/blog/2015/01/15/the-10-most-popular-cadsoft-eagle-libraries" %}

Creating a top-level folder, e.g. `eagle_external_libraries`, and adding that to your `Libraries` `Directories` path under `Options` as `$EAGLEDIR/lbr:$HOME/Workspace/eagle_external_libraries` gives you a single location to add all these gems.

## Personal Library

Recently I had to re-collect all these libraries after an unfortunate reinstall. I've decided to now start my {% include external link="https://github.com/christophevg/eagle_personal_libraries" title="personal set of libraries" %}, containing basically copies of and newly created or adapted parts for all parts that I use.

Again extending the `Libraries` path, adding this repository, `...:$HOME/Workspace/eagle_personal_libraries` puts everything nicely available at your finger tips.

# Notes

There is a lot of details to know about Eagle. {% include external link="https://google.com" title="Google" %} is your friend. Here are the ones I had to look up:

## Give Symbol Pins the Same Name

Sometimes multiple pins on a part carry the same name (`GND`, `DNC`,...). The symbol editor doesn't allow this. By adding a suffix of the format `@x` with `x` a number, the pins have different names, but in the schema representation, these suffixes aren't visible. E.g. `GND@1`, `GND@2` both become `GND`.
