When I started doing some real iOS app development, I had to find my way through a whole eco-system. These are my notes as I waded through Xcode, account setup, code signing, Swift,...

# Administrative

* It is possible to develop iOS applications and [deploy them to a device without an apple developer account](http://blog.ionic.io/deploying-to-a-device-without-an-apple-developer-account/)

# Swift

I decided to skip Objective-C and start with Swift. My first experiments were based on adapting existing code, which gave me an intrigued feeling. So I sought a book to read about Swift from basic variable to extensions and more.

[iOS 10 Programming Fundamentals with Swift](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920055211.do) is exactly that book. It consists of three parts dealing with Swift, XCode and Cocoa. All start from zero and evolve to a complete overview of all fundamentals. A real page-turner.

After finishing the first part on Swift, I wanted to get my hands dirty and I implemented a [Mastermind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mastermind_(board_game)) solver, trying out as many good Swift idioms as possible to get a good feeling of the pros and cons of this language that seemed to implement most of my wishes for a programming language. The code can be found on [my GitHub account](https://github.com/christophevg/mastermind). Pull requests to improve (my basic understanding and limited experience with) the Swift implementation are always welcomed ;-)

I've also ordered [Programming iOS 10](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920055235.do) to continue my research ;-)
