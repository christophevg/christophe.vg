I know, I'm late to the WS2811 party. But better late than never ;-) During the Christmas period of the _wonderful_ year 2020, we decided to make a "Happy New Year" sign ... with a lot of colorful lights. WS2811 to the rescue!

## Setup

I decided to go with a [Raspberry Pi](Raspberry_Pi) as the computing platform, because it's a bit more luxuriuos in comparison to a real real-time platform such as Arduino ;-)

### Hardware

One downside of using a Raspberry Pi is that its IO pins are 3.3V and WS2811 requires 5V. Now, it _can_ work, and in all honesty, simply hooking up a 50 LED string to a Pi did work out for me on the first try. But before moving our project off the workbench into the real world, I'll probably introduce a 74AHCT125 to convert the level.

For now, I simply connected a 5V power supply to the ledstring, connected the ground signal to the Pi's ground and hooked up the data signal wire to GPIO18. Little magic there.

### Software

Thanks to the Adafruit CircuitPython NeoPixel library, NeoPixels or WS2811/WS2812 LEDs can be controlled directly from your Raspberry Pi using Python!

```console
$ sudo pip3 install rpi_ws281x adafruit-circuitpython-neopixel
$ sudo python3 -m pip install --force-reinstall adafruit-blinka
```

### First Experiments

```console
$ sudo python3
Python 3.7.3 (default, Jul 25 2020, 13:03:44) 
[GCC 8.3.0] on linux
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> import board
>>> import neopixel
>>> pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(board.D18, 50)
>>> pixels[0] = (255, 0, 0)
```

```python
# rainbow.py - the obligatory RGB led showcase ;-)
import time
import board
import neopixel

pixel_pin = board.D18
num_pixels = 50
ORDER = neopixel.GRB
pixels = neopixel.NeoPixel(
  pixel_pin, num_pixels, brightness=0.2, auto_write=False, pixel_order=ORDER
)

def wheel(pos):
  # Input a value 0 to 255 to get a color value.
  # The colours are a transition r - g - b - back to r.
  if pos < 0 or pos > 255:
    r = g = b = 0
  elif pos < 85:
    r = int(pos * 3)
    g = int(255 - pos * 3)
    b = 0
  elif pos < 170:
    pos -= 85
    r = int(255 - pos * 3)
    g = 0
    b = int(pos * 3)
  else:
    pos -= 170
    r = 0
    g = int(pos * 3)
    b = int(255 - pos * 3)
  return (r, g, b) if ORDER in (neopixel.RGB, neopixel.GRB) else (r, g, b, 0)

def rainbow_cycle(wait):
  for j in range(255):
    for i in range(num_pixels):
      pixel_index = (i * 256 // num_pixels) + j
      pixels[i] = wheel(pixel_index & 255)
    pixels.show()
    time.sleep(wait)

while True:
  rainbow_cycle(0.001)  # rainbow cycle with 1ms delay per step
```

```console
$ sudo python3 rainbow.py
```
