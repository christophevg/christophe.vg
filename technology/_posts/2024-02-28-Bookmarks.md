Let's go old-skool 😇 I've never been great at using bookmarks in my browser, and don't really "use" a lot of sites - papa Google seems to be sort of my bookmarks collection. Still now and then I do stumble upon a site that I appreciate and want to use again in a distant future, yet most of the time by that time I don't recall it.

This website is primarily my personal notebook, filled with [recipes](/koken), [tech notes](/technology), [sailing log entries](/zeilen) and [general ramblings](/about) - these bookmarks should fit right in.

So without further adieu: my (growing) curated bookmarks collection:

## Making 🛠️

It's a [section](/makes), so over time I've collected useful resources/services that I can use while making stuff:

* {% include external link="https://templatemaker.nl" %} - a lot of credits to M. H. van der Velde for creating and hosting this free box/bag-template generating service.

## DTP 👨🏻‍💻

A lot of my work both professionally and personally comes down to some sort of DTP (DeskTop Publishing for those who weren't around in the 90's). Today this mostly boils down to the wonderful Pages and Keynote apps from the {% include external link="https://www.apple.com/iwork/" title="iWork Suite" %}.

But now and then, I need something more and these sites are useful additions:

* {% include external link="https://snazzymaps.com" %} - pimp your Google maps
* {% include external link="https://fontmeme.com" %} - great source of free fonts - clean and simple
* {% include external link="https://pixabay.com" %} - as their tagline states: tunning royalty-free images & royalty-free stock. Found it while looking for some background music.

## Software 🤓

Over the years my development stack has really converged, and so are the tools I use.

* {% include external link="https://realfavicongenerator.net" %} - to convert a logo design for some app into a complete set of icons for the web.
* {% include external link="https://www.jsontest.com" %} - several JSON returning services, useful as a QnD initial online JSON testdata provider.
* {% include external link="https://www.asciiart.eu" %} - because your warez simply _need_ some ASCII art pizzazz

## Running 🏃

Although it doesn't have a section on this site, running is one activity that tends to take up quiet some part of my free time.

* {% include external link="https://www.plotaroute.com" %} - is a great tool to ... plot a route 😇 It allows exporting routes to GPX, which I then can import in...
* {% include external link="https://www.rungoapp.com" %} - the free version of the {% include external link="https://apps.apple.com/app/rungo-guided-runs-turn-by/id712628644" title="RunGo app" %} allows me to do just what I want: import GPX, save it to my watch and have turn-by-turn audio navigation.
* {% include external link="https://runalyze.com" %} - for some time, this has become my centralised, statistical analysis tool for all my runs. I can sync from my favorite {% include external link="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ismoothrun/id410965399" title="tracking app" %} and applies too many scientific statistical algorithms, for my nerdy insight pleasure
* {% include external link="https://wearerunning.be" %} - contains all running events from January through December (in Belgium). Typically I try to attend a lot of these.

## Various 👋

* Every project, application,... needs a good name. For all your naming needs: {% include external link="https://namelix.com" %} has got you covered.
